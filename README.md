# Finding Answers

## Powerhome team on Stackoverflow

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a great resource for researching solutions to technical problems. You will be utilizing it for the rest of your career as a web developer. However, nothing on StackOverflow is specific to Nitro itself.

Recognizing the scalibility of the question/answer format of StackOverflow, Power's BT department decided to create their own team to this platform in May of 2018. Verify that you have access to by clicking on https://stackoverflow.com/c/powerhome/questions . Then immediately bookmark this page!

## Wiki Documentation

A source of BT department organizational and technical documentation lives in our internal Wiki documentation, living at https://wiki.powerhrg.com/Home . You have likely viewed this resource before. If you have not already bookmarked the page, do so now, and spend some time skimming over the site. Clicking on the `All` button in the nav bar will list every existing page to date.

At the time of writing this lesson, the majority of new content getting added to our "Wiki Docs" is Agile and Scrum focused. This also is a central storage place for lower level technical configurations that DevOps engineers use.

## Developer Documentation in Nitro

An older source of technical instruction for coding in `nitro-web` lives right in Nitro at https://nitro.powerhrg.com/dev_docs . Dating back to February of 2014, `dev_docs` contains a lot of valuable breakdowns of creating modals, configuring nitro searches, and various other standard practices found all over `nitro-web`. Take some time now to skim over some of these resources, and yes, bookmark this page.

## `README.md`s in `nitro-web`

Often the best source of reading and processing a codebase lives right in the code itself. `nitro-web` contains continuely updated `README.md`s that describe the architecture and common practices in the project. Here are some of note (relevant to the time this lesson was written):

- [README Table of Contents](https://github.com/powerhome/nitro-web/blob/master/README.md) that lives on root
- [Nitro Components](https://github.com/powerhome/nitro-web/blob/master/components/README.md)
- [Yarn Workspaces in Nitro](https://github.com/powerhome/nitro-web/blob/master/docs/USING_YARN_WORKSPACES.md)
- [Nitro on APP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/powerhome/nitro-web/blob/master/docs/NITRO_ON_APP.md)
- [Nitro News](https://github.com/powerhome/nitro-web/blob/master/news.md)
